## R-Programming Demo Data
Before using R for real-world problems learners gain experiences about the methods by exploring the results and processing workflows with demo data. 
Demo data is very helpful for an educational environment due to the fact that real data can be privacy protected (e.g. in health, ...).

### Origine of the Datasets
The datasets are created by [guru99-edu](https://www.github.com/guru99-edu) and provided to you with the repository [R-Programming](https://www.github.com/guru99-edu/R-Programming). If you use this dataset from this repository, please provide credits to [guru99-edu](https://www.github.com/guru99-edu) and add a reference to source repository  https://www.github.com/guru99-edu/R-Programming and not to this fork of the source directory. Thank you.

### Application of Datasets 
The sample datasets by [guru99-edu](https://www.github.com/guru99-edu) are used 
* in the context of [Wikiversity learning resource about KnitR](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/KnitR) and
* in conjunction with the repository [knitr4education](https://www.github.com/niebert/knitr4eduction)
